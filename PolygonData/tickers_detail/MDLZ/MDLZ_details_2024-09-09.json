The firm is a leading player in the global snack enclave with a presence in the biscuit (49% of sales), chocolate (30%), gum/candy (12%), beverage (3%), and cheese and grocery (6%) aisles, as of the end of fiscal 2023. Mondelez's portfolio includes well-known brands like Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Halls, and Cadbury, among others. The firm derives around one third of revenue from developing markets, just more than one third from Europe, and the remainder from North America.","sic_code":"2000","sic_description":"FOOD AND KINDRED PRODUCTS","ticker_root":"MDLZ","homepage_url":"https://www.mondelezinternational.com","total_employees":91000,"list_date":"2001-06-13","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/bW9uZGVsZXppbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbQ/images/2024-09-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/bW9uZGVsZXppbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbQ/images/2024-09-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":1335800000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":1335797706,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
