The firm is a leading player in the global snack arena with a presence in the biscuit (50% of sales), chocolate (30%), gum/candy (11%), beverage (3%), and cheese and grocery (6%) aisles, as of the end of fiscal 2022. Mondelez's portfolio includes well-known brands like Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Halls, and Cadbury, among others. The firm derives just shy of 40% of revenue from developing markets, about one third from Europe, and the remainder from North America.","sic_code":"2000","sic_description":"FOOD AND KINDRED PRODUCTS","ticker_root":"MDLZ","homepage_url":"https://www.mondelezinternational.com","total_employees":91000,"list_date":"2001-06-13","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/bW9uZGVsZXppbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbQ/images/2023-12-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/bW9uZGVsZXppbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbQ/images/2023-12-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":1360900000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":1360895585,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
