About 80% of AppLovin's revenue comes from the DSP, AppDiscovery, while the remainder comes from the SSP, Max, and gaming studios, which develop mobile games. AppLovin announced in February 2025 its plans to divest from the lower-margin gaming studios to focus exclusively on the ad tech platform. AppLovin's primary tool for future growth is Axon 2, which is an ad optimizer operating within the DSP that allows advertisers to place ads according to specified return thresholds.","sic_code":"7370","sic_description":"SERVICES-COMPUTER PROGRAMMING, DATA PROCESSING, ETC.","ticker_root":"APP","homepage_url":"https://www.applovin.com","total_employees":1563,"list_date":"2021-04-15","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/YXBwbG92aW4uY29t/images/2024-10-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/YXBwbG92aW4uY29t/images/2024-10-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":309270000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":339958231,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
