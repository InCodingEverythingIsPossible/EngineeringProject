More than half of revenue comes from MCUs, which are used in a wide array of electronic devices from remote controls to garage door openers to power windows in autos. The company's strength lies in lower-end 8-bit MCUs that are suitable for a wider range of less technologically advanced devices, but the firm has expanded its presence in higher-end MCUs and analog chips as well.","sic_code":"3674","sic_description":"SEMICONDUCTORS & RELATED DEVICES","ticker_root":"MCHP","homepage_url":"https://www.microchip.com","total_employees":22300,"list_date":"1993-03-26","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/bWljcm9jaGlwLmNvbQ/images/2024-10-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/bWljcm9jaGlwLmNvbQ/images/2024-10-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":536890000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":536885996,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
