More than half of revenue comes from MCUs, which are used in a wide array of electronic devices from remote controls to garage door openers to power windows in autos. The company's strength lies in lower-end 8-bit MCUs that are suitable for a wider range of less technologically advanced devices, but the firm has expanded its presence in higher-end MCUs and analog chips as well.","sic_code":"3674","sic_description":"SEMICONDUCTORS & RELATED DEVICES","ticker_root":"MCHP","homepage_url":"https://www.microchip.com","total_employees":22600,"list_date":"1993-03-26","share_class_shares_outstanding":544330000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":544334286,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
