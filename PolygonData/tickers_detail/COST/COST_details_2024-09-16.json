The firm avoids maintaining costly product displays by keeping inventory on pallets and limits distribution expenses by storing its inventory at point of sale in the warehouse. Given Costco's frugal cost structure, the firm is able to price its merchandise below competing retailers, driving high sales volume per warehouse and allowing the retailer to generate strong profits on thin margins. Costco operates over 600 warehouses in the United States and enjoys over 60% market share in the domestic warehouse club industry. Internationally, Costco operates another 270 warehouses, primarily in markets such as Canada, Mexico, Japan, and the UK.","sic_code":"5331","sic_description":"RETAIL-VARIETY STORES","ticker_root":"COST","homepage_url":"https://www.costco.com","total_employees":316000,"list_date":"1985-11-27","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/Y29zdGNvLmNvbQ/images/2024-09-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/Y29zdGNvLmNvbQ/images/2024-09-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":443340000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":443335024,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
