The firm avoids maintaining costly product displays by keeping inventory on pallets and limits distribution expenses by storing its inventory at point of sale in the warehouse. Given its frugal cost structure, the firm is able to price its merchandise below that of competing retailers, driving high sales volume per warehouse and generating strong profits on thin margins. Costco operates over 600 warehouses in the United States and has over 60% share in the domestic warehouse club industry. Internationally, Costco operates another 280 warehouses, primarily in Canada, Mexico, Japan, and the UK.","sic_code":"5331","sic_description":"RETAIL-VARIETY STORES","ticker_root":"COST","homepage_url":"https://www.costco.com","total_employees":333000,"list_date":"1985-11-27","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/Y29zdGNvLmNvbQ/images/2024-10-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/Y29zdGNvLmNvbQ/images/2024-10-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":443900000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":443683357,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
