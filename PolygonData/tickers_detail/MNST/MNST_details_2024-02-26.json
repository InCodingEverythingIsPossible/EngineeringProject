The well-known Monster trademark includes brands such as Monster Energy, Monster Ultra, Java Monster, and Juice Monster. The firm also owns other energy drink brands, such as Reign, NOS, Burn, and Mother, and brews and distributes beers and flavored malt beverages following the acquisition of a craft brewer in 2022. Monster controls branding and innovation but outsources beverage manufacturing and packaging to copackers and finished goods distribution to bottlers in the global Coca-Cola system (pursuant to a 20-year agreement inked in 2015). Coke is the largest shareholder of Monster with a 19.5% stake.","sic_code":"2086","sic_description":"BOTTLED & CANNED SOFT DRINKS & CARBONATED WATERS","ticker_root":"MNST","homepage_url":"https://www.monsterbevcorp.com","total_employees":5296,"list_date":"1995-08-18","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/bW9uc3RlcmJldmNvcnAuY29t/images/2024-02-01_logo.png","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/bW9uc3RlcmJldmNvcnAuY29t/images/2024-02-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":1040440000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":1040636235,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
