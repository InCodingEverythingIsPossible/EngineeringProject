It has the biggest television entertainment subscriber base in both the United States and the collective international market, with more than 275 million subscribers globally. Netflix has exposure to nearly the entire global population outside of China. The firm has traditionally avoided live programming or sports content, instead focusing on on-demand access to episodic television, movies, and documentaries. The firm recently began introducing ad-supported subscription plans, giving the firm exposure to the advertising market in addition to the subscription fees that have historically accounted for nearly all its revenue.","sic_code":"7841","sic_description":"SERVICES-VIDEO TAPE RENTAL","ticker_root":"NFLX","homepage_url":"https://www.netflix.com","total_employees":13000,"list_date":"2002-05-23","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/bmV0ZmxpeC5jb20/images/2024-07-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/bmV0ZmxpeC5jb20/images/2024-07-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":429170000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":429164615,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
