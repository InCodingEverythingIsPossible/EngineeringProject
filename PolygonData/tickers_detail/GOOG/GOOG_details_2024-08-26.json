Internet media giant Google is a wholly owned subsidiary. Google services account for nearly 90% of Alphabet's revenue, of which more than 85% is from online ads. Other Google services revenue is from sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, as well as sales of hardware such as Chromebooks, the Pixel smartphone, and smart home products, which include Nest and Google Home. Google's cloud computing offerings account for a bit more than 10% of total Alphabet revenue. Alphabet's moonshot investments are in its other bets segment, where it bets on technology to enhance health (Verily), provide faster internet access (Google Fiber), enable self-driving cars (Waymo), and more.","sic_code":"7370","sic_description":"SERVICES-COMPUTER PROGRAMMING, DATA PROCESSING, ETC.","ticker_root":"GOOG","homepage_url":"https://www.abc.xyz","total_employees":180895,"list_date":"2004-08-19","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/YWJjLnh5eg/images/2024-08-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/YWJjLnh5eg/images/2024-08-01_icon.png"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":5627980000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":12358000000,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
