Internet media giant Google is a wholly owned subsidiary. Google generates 99% of Alphabet revenue, of which more than 85% is from online ads. Google's other revenue is from sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, as well as cloud service fees and other licensing revenue. Sales of hardware such as Chromebooks, the Pixel smartphone, and smart home products, which include Nest and Google Home, also contribute to other revenue. Alphabet's moonshot investments are in its other bets segment, where it bets on technology to enhance health (Verily), faster internet access to homes (Google Fiber), self-driving cars (Waymo), and more. Alphabet's operating margin has been 25%-30%, with Google at 30% and other bets operating at a loss.","sic_code":"7370","sic_description":"SERVICES-COMPUTER PROGRAMMING, DATA PROCESSING, ETC.","ticker_root":"GOOG","homepage_url":"https://www.abc.xyz","total_employees":190711,"list_date":"2004-08-19","share_class_shares_outstanding":5874000000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":12697000000,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
