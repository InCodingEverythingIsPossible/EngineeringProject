The company manufactures and distributes coffee systems (including coffee brewers and single-serve coffee pods) under the Keurig and Green Mountain brands, as well as ready-to-drink beverages including flavored (non-cola) sparkling soft drinks under well-known brands such as Dr Pepper, Snapple, and Canada Dry. The company controls production and route to market for its own brands through in-house manufacturing plants and distribution infrastructure and leverages these facilities to manufacture and distribute for third-party coffee and beverage brands via licensing and partnership agreements. U.S. and Canada make up 95% of revenues, with the rest from Mexico.","sic_code":"2080","sic_description":"BEVERAGES","ticker_root":"KDP","homepage_url":"https://www.keurigdrpepper.com","total_employees":28100,"list_date":"2008-05-07","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/a2V1cmlnZHJwZXBwZXIuY29t/images/2024-03-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/a2V1cmlnZHJwZXBwZXIuY29t/images/2024-03-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":1387590000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":1352591010,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
