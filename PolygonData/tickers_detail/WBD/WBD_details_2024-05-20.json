Discovery was formed in 2022 through the combination of WarnerMedia and Discovery Communications. It operates in three global business segments: studios, networks, and direct-to-consumer. Warner Bros. Pictures is the crown jewel of the studios business, producing, distributing, and licensing movies and television shows. The networks business consists of basic cable networks, such as CNN, TNT, TBS, Discovery, HGTV, and the Food Network. Direct-to-consumer includes HBO and the firm's streaming platforms, which have now been consolidated to Max and Discovery+. Much of the DTC content is created within the firm's other two business segments. Each segment operates with a global reach, with Max available in over 60 countries.","sic_code":"4841","sic_description":"CABLE & OTHER PAY TELEVISION SERVICES","ticker_root":"WBD","homepage_url":"https://www.wbd.com","total_employees":35300,"list_date":"2005-07-06","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/d2JkLmNvbQ/images/2024-05-09_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/d2JkLmNvbQ/images/2024-05-09_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":2450310000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":2450313398,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
