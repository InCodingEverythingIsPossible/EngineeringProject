Its main focus is the design and manufacturing of microprocessors for the global personal computer and data center markets. Intel pioneered the x86 architecture for microprocessors and was the prime proponent of Moore's law for advances in semiconductor manufacturing. While Intel's server processor business has benefited from the shift to the cloud, the firm has also been expanding into new adjacencies as the personal computer market has stagnated. These include areas such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and automotive.","sic_code":"3674","sic_description":"SEMICONDUCTORS & RELATED DEVICES","ticker_root":"INTC","homepage_url":"https://www.intel.com","total_employees":131900,"list_date":"1971-10-13","share_class_shares_outstanding":4188000000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":4188000000,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
