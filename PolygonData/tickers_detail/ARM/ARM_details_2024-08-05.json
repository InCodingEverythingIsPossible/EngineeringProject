Arm licenses its architecture for a fee, offering different types of licenses depending on the flexibility the customer needs. Customers like Apple or Qualcomm buy architectural licenses, which allows them to modify the architecture and add or delete instructions to tailor the chips to their specific needs. Other clients directly buy off-the-shelf designs from Arm. Off-the-shelf and architectural customers pay a royalty fee per chip shipped.","ticker_root":"ARM","homepage_url":"https://www.arm.com","total_employees":7320,"list_date":"2023-09-14","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/YXJtLmNvbQ/images/2024-08-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/YXJtLmNvbQ/images/2024-08-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":1040329999,"weighted_shares_outstanding":1048000000,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
