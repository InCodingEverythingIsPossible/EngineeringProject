The firm has grown its business organically and through acquisitions, and today Cintas acts as a one-stop outsourcing partner for businesses. Cintas will design, manufacture, collect, and clean every employee uniform for a small weekly sum, taking on the upfront capital expense itself. In the same stop, Cintas can also replace soiled or depleted mats, mops, trash liners, towels, first aid, fire, and cleaning products. Businesses value an outsourcing partner like Cintas as it simplifies operations and leaves noncore tasks with high regulatory standards in the hands of professionals.","sic_code":"2320","sic_description":"MEN'S & BOYS' FURNISHGS, WORK CLOTHG, & ALLIED GARMENTS","ticker_root":"CTAS","homepage_url":"https://www.cintas.com","total_employees":46500,"list_date":"1983-08-18","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/Y2ludGFzLmNvbQ/images/2024-10-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/Y2ludGFzLmNvbQ/images/2024-10-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":403540000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":403543932,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
