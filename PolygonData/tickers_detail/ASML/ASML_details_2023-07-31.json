Photolithography is the process in which a light source is used to expose circuit patterns from a photomask onto a semiconductor wafer. The latest technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically representing a meaningful portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips. Chipmakers require next-generation EUV lithography tools to continue past the 5-nanometer process node, which only ASML can provide. ASML's products are used at every major semiconductor manufacturer, including Intel, Samsung, and TSMC.","ticker_root":"ASML","homepage_url":"https://www.asml.com","total_employees":41542,"list_date":"1995-03-15","share_class_shares_outstanding":403140000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":393400000,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
