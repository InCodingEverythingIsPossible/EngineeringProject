Photolithography is the process in which a light source is used to expose circuit patterns from a photomask onto a semiconductor wafer. The latest technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically representing a meaningful portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips. Chipmakers require next-generation EUV lithography tools to continue past the 5-nanometer process node, which only ASML can provide. ASML's products are used at every major semiconductor manufacturer, including Intel, Samsung, and TSMC.","ticker_root":"ASML","homepage_url":"https://www.asml.com","total_employees":42266,"list_date":"1995-03-15","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/YXNtbC5jb20/images/2023-11-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/YXNtbC5jb20/images/2023-11-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":403140000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":394589762,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
