Photolithography is the process in which a light source is used to expose circuit patterns from a photo mask onto a semiconductor wafer. The latest technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically representing a high portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips. ASML outsources the manufacturing of most of its parts, acting like an assembler. ASML's main clients are TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.","ticker_root":"ASML","homepage_url":"https://www.asml.com","total_employees":42713,"list_date":"1995-03-15","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/YXNtbC5jb20/images/2024-10-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/YXNtbC5jb20/images/2024-10-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":399590000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":393421721,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
