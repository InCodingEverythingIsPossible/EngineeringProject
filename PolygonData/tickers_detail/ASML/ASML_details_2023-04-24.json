Photolithography is the process in which a light source is used to expose circuit patterns from a photomask onto a semiconductor wafer. The latest technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically representing a meaningful portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips. Chipmakers require next-generation EUV lithography tools from ASML to continue past the 3-nanometer process node. ASML's products are used at every major semiconductor manufacturer, including Intel, Samsung, and TSMC.","ticker_root":"ASML","homepage_url":"https://www.asml.com","total_employees":33190,"list_date":"1995-03-15","share_class_shares_outstanding":403140000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":394589597,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
