The firm opportunistically procures excess brand-name merchandise made available via manufacturing overruns and retail liquidation sales at a 20%-60% discount to full prices. As such, its stores are often filled with a vast array of stock-keeping units, each with minimal product depth that creates a treasure hunt shopping experience. The firm's more than 1,750 Ross Dress for Less stores are primarily located in densely populated suburban communities and typically serve middle-income consumers. Ross also operates nearly 350 DD's Discounts chains that target lower-income shoppers.","sic_code":"5651","sic_description":"RETAIL-FAMILY CLOTHING STORES","ticker_root":"ROST","homepage_url":"https://www.rossstores.com","total_employees":101000,"list_date":"1985-08-08","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/cm9zc3N0b3Jlcy5jb20/images/2024-05-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/cm9zc3N0b3Jlcy5jb20/images/2024-05-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":335310000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":335307087,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
