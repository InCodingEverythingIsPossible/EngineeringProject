Ross offers a variety of name-brand products and targets undercutting conventional retailers' regular prices by 20%-70%. The company uses an opportunistic, flexible merchandising approach; together with a relatively low-frills shopping environment centered on a treasure-hunt experience, Ross maximizes inventory turnover and traffic, enabling its low-price approach. In fiscal 2022, 26% of sales came from home accents (including bed and bath), 24% from the ladies' department, 15% from menswear, 14% from accessories, 12% from shoes, and 9% from children's.
