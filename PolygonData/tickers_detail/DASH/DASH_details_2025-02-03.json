Consumers can use its app to order food items on-demand for delivery or in-store from merchants. Through the acquisition of Wolt in 2022, the firm also provides this service in Europe and Asia. DoorDash creates a marketplace for merchants to establish a presence online, market their offerings, and meet demand through delivery. The firm provides similar service to nonrestaurant businesses, such as grocery, retail, and pet supplies. Dash is also rolling out nascent technology like drone delivery in an effort to continually innovate and provide the best possible service to supply-side and demand-side contingents of its marketplace.","sic_code":"7389","sic_description":"SERVICES-BUSINESS SERVICES, NEC","ticker_root":"DASH","homepage_url":"https://www.doordash.com","total_employees":19300,"list_date":"2020-12-09","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/ZG9vcmRhc2guY29t/images/2024-10-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/ZG9vcmRhc2guY29t/images/2024-10-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":388980000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":415396239,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
