The firm's culture emphasizes acquiring asset-light, cash-generative businesses. Roper then reinvests this excess cash in businesses that yield incrementally higher rates of return. While the businesses are managed in a decentralized manner, Roper does not passively manage its portfolio. Instead, Roper manages its businesses through the Socratic method and empowers decision-makers through group executive coaching. Roper has now rotated a clear majority of its business from legacy industrial products into technology software in mature, niche markets with large quantities of deferred revenue.","sic_code":"3823","sic_description":"INDUSTRIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASUREMENT, DISPLAY, AND CONTROL","ticker_root":"ROP","homepage_url":"https://www.ropertech.com","total_employees":15800,"list_date":"1996-11-01","share_class_shares_outstanding":106590000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":106592234,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
