Other inventions by Honeywell include biodegradable detergent and autopilot. Today, Honeywell is a global multi-industry behemoth with one of the largest installed bases of equipment. It operates through four business segments: aerospace technologies (37% of 2023 company revenue), industrial automation (29%), energy and sustainability solutions (17%), and building automation (17%). Recently, Honeywell has made several portfolio changes to focus on fewer end markets and align with a set of secular growth trends. The firm is working diligently to expand its installed base, deriving 30% of its revenue from recurring aftermarket services.","sic_code":"3724","sic_description":"AIRCRAFT ENGINES & ENGINE PARTS","ticker_root":"HON","homepage_url":"https://www.honeywell.com","total_employees":95000,"list_date":"1929-09-19","branding":{"logo_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/aG9uZXl3ZWxsLmNvbQ/images/2024-06-01_logo.svg","icon_url":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/aG9uZXl3ZWxsLmNvbQ/images/2024-06-01_icon.jpeg"},"share_class_shares_outstanding":651190000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":651185513,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
