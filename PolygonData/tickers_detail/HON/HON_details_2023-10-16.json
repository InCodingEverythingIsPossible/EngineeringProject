Today, Honeywell is a global multi-industry behemoth with one of the largest installed bases of equipment. It operates through four business segments: aerospace, building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions. In recent years, the firm has made several portfolio changes, including the addition of Intelligrated in 2016, as well as the spinoffs of Garrett Technologies and Resideo in 2018. In 2019, the firm launched Honeywell Forge, its enterprise performance management software solution that leverages the firm's domain expertise in buildings, airlines, and critical infrastructure.","sic_code":"3724","sic_description":"AIRCRAFT ENGINES & ENGINE PARTS","ticker_root":"HON","homepage_url":"https://www.honeywell.com","total_employees":97000,"list_date":"1929-09-19","share_class_shares_outstanding":663960000,"weighted_shares_outstanding":663961433,"round_lot":100},"status":"OK"}
